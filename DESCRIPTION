Description: The rivSurveyR package accepts acoustic Doppler current profiler
    (ADCP) data exported from SonTek's RiverSurveyor Live program as MATLAB files
    and allows quick summarization and plotting of water velocities. It is capable
    of projecting replicate transects to a mean transect line and averaging measured
    values that overlap in geographic space. Planform and secondary velocities from
    multiple ADCP transects can be processed at once and multiple rotation methods
    can be used to determine secondary velocities. Planform flow data can be plotted
    in geographic space and cross-section plots of secondary velocities can easily
    be constructed.
